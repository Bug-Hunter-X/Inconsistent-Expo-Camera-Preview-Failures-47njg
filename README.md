# Inconsistent Expo Camera Preview Failures in Expo

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API. The issue involves intermittent failures to start the camera preview, with vague error messages providing little debugging information. The problem appears to be related to hardware incompatibility or driver issues on some devices.

## Reproducing the Issue

The `cameraBug.js` file contains code that attempts to initialize the Expo Camera.  On some devices, this will result in a failure to start the preview, while on others, it will work correctly.  There is no clear pattern to predict which devices will exhibit the error.

## Proposed Solution

The `cameraBugSolution.js` file offers a potential workaround. While not a perfect fix, this approach incorporates error handling and attempts to provide feedback to the user, improving the overall user experience.
