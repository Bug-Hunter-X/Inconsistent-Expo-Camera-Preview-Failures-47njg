This error occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with certain camera hardware.  The error message is vague, often simply mentioning a `null` value or failing to start the camera preview. It's particularly frustrating because it's not consistently reproducible across devices and doesn't provide clues for debugging. The cause seems related to how the Expo Camera module interacts with the native camera hardware on some devices, particularly older or less common models.
